# Tao Te Ching

"Tao Te Ching" is a Chinese classic text written by the ancient Chinese philosopher Lau Tzu. This English version is translated by me based on previous translations, with special reference to Ursula K. Le Guin's translation which serves as the starting point for creating my own version. 

I'm taking the original translation and making changes, revisions, and updates to it to make it more suitable to better convey the meaning of the text based on my own understanding.
