# 1 - TAOING

The way can be spoken of,  
is not the constant way.   

The name can be named,  
is not the constant name.   

Sky and earth begin in the unnamed:  
name’s the mother of the ten thousand things.  

So the unwanted soul sees what’s hidden,  
and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants.  

Two things, one origin,  
but different in name,  
whose identity is mystery.  
Mystery of all mysteries!  
The door to the hidden.  


> **Note** UKLG: A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly impossible. It contains the book. I think of it as the Aleph, in Borges’s story: if you can see it rightly, it contains everything.
