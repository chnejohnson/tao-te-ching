# 70 - BEING OBSCURE



My words are so easy to understand,  
so easy to follow,  

and yet nobody in the world  
understands or follows them.  

Words come from an ancestry,  
deeds from a mastery:  
when these are unknown, so am I.  

In my obscurity  
is my value.  
Thatâ€™s why the wise  
wear their jade under common clothes.
