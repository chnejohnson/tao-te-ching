# 61 - LYING LOW



The polity of greatness  
runs downhill like a river to the sea,  
joining with everything,  
woman to everything.  

By stillness the woman  
may always dominate the man,  
lying quiet underneath him.  

So a great country  
submitting to small ones, dominates them;  
so small countries,  
submitting to a great one, dominate it.  

Lie low to be on top,  
be on top by lying low.
