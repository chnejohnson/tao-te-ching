# 7 - DIM BRIGHTNESS

Sky lasts and earth endures. 

The way in which they can last is that they don't live for themselves, and so can go on and on.

So a master leaving self behind move forward, and setting self aside stay centered.  

Isn't ze selfless? So can fulfill zirself.

天長地久。

天地所以能長且久者，以其不自生，故能長生。

是以聖人後其身而身先；外其身而身存。

非以其無私耶？故能成其私。
