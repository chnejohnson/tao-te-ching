# 81 - TELLING IT TRUE



True words aren’t charming,  
charming words aren’t true.   
Good people aren’t contentious,   
contentious people aren’t good.   
People who know aren’t learned,   
learned people don’t know.   

Wise souls don’t hoard;   
the more they do for others the more they have,   
the more they give the richer they are.   

The Way of sky benefits instead of destroying.     
The Way of a master acts instead of competing.
