# 33 - KINDS OF POWER



Knowing other people is intelligence,  
knowing yourself is wisdom.  
Overcoming others takes strength,  
overcoming yourself takes greatness.  
Contentment is wealth.  

Boldly pushing forward takes resolution.  
Staying put keeps you in position.  

To live till you die  
is to live long enough.
