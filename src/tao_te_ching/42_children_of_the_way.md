# 42 - CHILDREN OF THE WAY



The way bears one.  
The one bears two.  
The two bear three.  
The three bear all things.  

All things carry the yin and hold the yang,  
and attribute harmony to the interplay of the force.  

People despise orphans, widowers, outcasts.  
Yet that’s what kings and rulers call themselves.  
Whatever you lose, you’ve won.  
Whatever you win, you’ve lost.  

What others teach, I say too:  
violence and aggression  
destroy themselves.  
My teaching rests on that.  


> **Note** UKLG: Beginning with a pocket cosmology, this chapter demonstrates the “interplay of energy” of yin and yang by showing how low and high, winning and losing, destruction and self-destruction, reverse themselves, each turning into its seeming opposite.
