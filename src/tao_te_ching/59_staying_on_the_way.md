# 59 - STAYING ON THE WAY



In looking after your life and following the way,  
gather spirit.  
Gather spirit early,  
and so redouble power,  
and so become invulnerable.  

Invulnerable, unlimited,  
you can do what you like with material things.  
But only if you hold to the Mother of things  
will you do it for long.  
Have deep roots, a strong trunk.  
Live long by looking long.
